### Career Overview

My career has spanned various sectors, including government, healthcare, banking, and now AI. I specialize in designing and scaling high-performance Java Spring Boot microservices for enterprise and fintech applications. My expertise spans multi-cloud deployment (GCP, Azure) and complex authentication systems.

Currently, I'm developing innovative solutions in AI and large codebase analysis at Devsu, leveraging modern full-stack technologies like TypeScript, React, and Deno.

Previously, I worked as a backend developer for [Ecuador's largest private bank](https://www.pichincha.com/), handling sensitive, large-scale projects. My academic roots as a [researcher at the Universidad Nacional de San Luis](https://fmn.unsl.edu.ar/curso-de-ingreso-2021-agradecimiento-a-docentes-y-tutores-del-curso-comprension-de-texto/) reflect my deep commitment to continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

### Why "Pollito"?

You might be wondering why this is **Pollito's Opinion** on Spring Boot Development.

"Pollito" (Spanish for "little chicken") has been my nickname since my very first birthday when my mother dressed me in bright yellow clothes. My relatives immediately started calling me "pollito," and the name just stuck!

Over the years, I've embraced this nickname as it's both original and memorable. In the tech world, where personal branding matters, having a distinctive identity has been surprisingly helpful. Plus, who doesn't smile when they hear about a developer named "little chicken" building enterprise systems for a major bank?

The chicken logo and the "pollito" brand have become my professional signature—a reminder that even serious work can maintain a touch of personality and warmth.

### Knowledge Sharing

This passion for education is also the foundation of my programming blog. There, I dive into the intricacies of web development (mainly in Java Spring Boot).

These documents represent my accumulated knowledge and experience with Spring Boot development—everything I wish someone had told me when I started my journey.
