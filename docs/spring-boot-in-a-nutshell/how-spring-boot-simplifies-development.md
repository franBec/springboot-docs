# How Spring Boot Simplifies Development

Spring Boot isn’t a replacement for Spring—it’s a supercharged extension that removes the grunt work. Here’s how it makes life easier:

* **Convention Over Configuration**: Predefined defaults for dependencies, project structure, and settings. No more XML hell!
* **Embedded Servers**: Pack a [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), [Jetty](https://jetty.org/index.html), or [Undertow](https://undertow.io/) server directly into your app. Just run the JAR—no external setup needed.
* **Starter Dependencies**: Need security, database access, or web capabilities? Add spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, and Spring Boot auto-configures the essentials.
* **Autoconfiguration**: Detects libraries in your classpath and sets up sensible defaults.
* **Production-Ready Tools**: Built-in metrics, health checks, and environment management via [Spring Actuator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v3.4.2/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator).

In short, Spring Boot lets you focus on writing business logic instead of wrestling with infrastructure.
