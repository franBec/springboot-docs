# First, What Is Spring?

Before understanding Spring Boot, you need to know its parent: Spring Framework. Spring is a powerful, open-source application framework for Java that simplifies enterprise-level development. Its core philosophy revolves around:

* **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Let the framework manage object creation and dependencies (via [Dependency injection](/lets-create-a-spring-boot-project/some-important-concepts)).
* **Modularity**: Pick and choose components for your needs.
* **Flexibility**: Supports everything from microservices to monolithic apps.

But with great power comes great configuration. Setting up a Spring project traditionally involves writing XML files and wrestling with boilerplate code. In the tutorial down below, it took approximately 30 minutes to get everything ready. Feel free to watch if curious, but there's no need.
