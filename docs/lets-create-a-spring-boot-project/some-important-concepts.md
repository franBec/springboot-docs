# Some Important Concepts Before We Continue

## Git

You wouldn't build a house without a safety harness. Don't code without [version control](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-version-control). Here are some tips:

1. **Git first, code second**: Always git init before writing your first line of code.
2. **Console > GUI**. Tools like GitHub Desktop are great, but learn these 4 commands first:

    `git add ., git commit -m "save point", git push, git checkout -b`

    Why? Because when your IDE's Git plugin mysteriously breaks (it will), you'll need to debug like a pro. 
3. **Your Team's Rules > Textbook Gitflow**: You might love feature branches, but every company has their own "sacred" workflow. Observe first, then suggest improvements later.
4. **The 15-Minute Git Survival Kit**: If for some reason you arrived here without Git basics, first of all... How? I‚Äôm surprised. Here is the survival kit:
   * [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/).
   * [GitHub Training Kit](https://training.github.com/).
   * Any YouTube tutorial you feel comfortable with.

## Formatters

A **formatter** automatically styles your code (indentation, spacing, line breaks) to enforce consistency. No more debates about "tabs vs. spaces".

Before imposing a formatter, check your team‚Äôs workflow:

* **If your team already uses a formatter** (e.g., [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org/), [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)), stick with their setup‚Äîconsistency > personal preference.
* **For existing projects without a formatter**, consult the team first. A sudden formatting overhaul in a shared codebase can bury meaningful changes in noise. If agreed, create a dedicated commit purely for formatting (no logic tweaks!) to simplify code reviews.

I recommend [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless). Why? Personal preference, it is the one I‚Äôve always used and haven‚Äôt bothered looking into others.

## Gradle Tasks

Think of Gradle as your code's personal assistant. These "tasks" are commands that:

* Compile code.
* Run tests.
* Package your app into a `JAR`.

IntelliJ IDEA provides a nice sidebar menu:

* Look for the elephant icon üêò on the right edge (Gradle Toolbar).
* Expand your-project > Tasks > build.

<div>
   <img src={require('@site/static/img/lets-create-a-spring-boot-project/gradle-tasks.png').default} alt="gradle tasks" />
</div>

The two tasks you'll actually use are **build** (compile + test + package into `JAR`) and **clean** (nuclear option when weird errors happen, it deletes all build files).

* Don't memorize all the tasks - just know these 2, and when you need others, Google is your best friend.

We‚Äôll skip Maven specifics here, but if you‚Äôve heard terms like `mvn clean install`‚Äîit‚Äôs the same circus, different clowns (Gradle just calls the tricks ‚Äòtasks‚Äô instead).

## Interfaces and Implementations

Let‚Äôs split this into two parts: the **interface** (the "what") and the **implementation** (the "how").

### What‚Äôs an Interface?

Think of an interface as a menu at a restaurant. It lists what dishes are available (methods), but not how they‚Äôre cooked.

### What‚Äôs an Implementation?

If the interface is the restaurant menu, the implementation is the kitchen actually cooking your order. It‚Äôs the grunt work ‚Äì the Java class that does what the interface promised.

### Why Does This Matter?

* **Flexibility**: Swap implementations without breaking code (e.g., switch from hardcoded data to a database later).
* **Testing**: Easily mock the interface to test other components.
* **Clarity**: Separates ‚Äúwhat‚Äù from ‚Äúhow‚Äù for cleaner code. Real implementations get messy ‚Äì that‚Äôs why we hide them behind clean interfaces
* Spring Boot automatically injects the right "kitchen" when you order a "dish" (this is called [Dependency injection](/lets-create-a-spring-boot-project/some-important-concepts#dependency-injection)).

## Dependency Injection

Let‚Äôs check once more the [Spring Boot Layers](/spring-boot-in-a-nutshell/spring-boot-layers) diagram and ask ourselves:

> How does each layer inside a Spring Boot Application communicate with each other?

<div>
   <img src={require('@site/static/img/lets-create-a-spring-boot-project/dependency-injection.png').default} alt="dependency injection" />
</div>

The answer: **Dependency Injection**.

In our diagram, the dependencies can be ‚Äúread‚Äù left to right:

* A Controller depends on a Service.
* A Service depends on a Repository.
* A Service depends on an ApiClient.

Let‚Äôs focus on the first one: ‚ÄúA Controller depends on a Service‚Äù. How do we write that? There are three ways to do that.

### Field Injection

```java
@RestController
public class CheckoutController {

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    //Controller logic
}
```

### Setter Injection

```java
@RestController
public class CheckoutController {

    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public void setPaymentService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    //Controller logic
}
```

### Constructor Injection

```java
@RestController
public class CheckoutController {

    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public CheckoutController(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    //Controller logic
}
```

**Constructor injection is the recommended approach**:

* **No nulls** ‚Äì Your dependencies arrive fully assembled.
* **Immutable** ‚Äì Can‚Äôt accidentally swap your database for a toaster mid-request.
* **Testing-friendly** ‚Äì No Spring magic needed in unit tests.

### Constructor Injection with Lombok

WIth Lombok, Constructor Injection is even simplified (and this is my recommended approach):

```java
@RestController
@RequiredArgConstructor // <-- Lombok annotation
public class CheckoutController {

    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    //Controller logic
}
```
