  For this document, we assume that you created a Spring Boot project using
  [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). If you didn't, you can clone
  the monorepo I've prepared at
  [https://github.com/franBec/springboot-demo-projects](https://github.com/franBec/springboot-demo-projects)
  branch `feature/initial-commit`.

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA** → File → Open → Select the unzipped project folder.
2. **First-time JDK setup** (if prompted):
   - IntelliJ will ask you to download a JDK. Choose the **same version** you selected in Spring Initializr (e.g., Java 21).
   - Click Download JDK and follow the prompts.
3. **Wait for background tasks**:
   - Look for progress indicators in the **lower-right corner** (e.g., "Downloading Gradle dependencies" or "Indexing").
   - Let these finish, they set up your project's tools and libraries.
4. **Run the application**:
   - Search for the Gradle tool window (in IntelliJ it's usually a small elephant icon on the right side).
   - Run the `build` command.
   - Run the `bootRun` command.
     <Image
       src={
         require('@site/static/img/lets-create-a-spring-boot-project/run-gradle-app.png')
           .default
       }
     />
5. **Check the run terminal:** After a few seconds, you'll see something similar to `Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/'`. This means your Spring Boot app is live!
6. **Test it out:** Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You'll see a Whitelabel Error Page. This is normal because we haven't done any development yet.

Congratulations! Your Spring Boot app is up and running.

Here's why this is a big deal:

**Before Spring Boot**, getting a Java app to listen on a port like 8080 required hours of manual setup:

- Configuring `XML` files (like `web.xml`).
- Deploying `WAR` files to an external server (e.g., Tomcat).
- Writing boilerplate code just to start the server.

**Today with Spring Boot**:

- The embedded Tomcat server starts automatically.
- Zero code needed: the `main()` method does everything.
- No `XML` or manual server setup.

You just witnessed Spring Boot's magic: turning what used to be a days-long chore into a 10-second task. And we haven't even written a single line of our own code yet!
