# Define Your Endpoints in a Contract

Given a User with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Leanne Graham",
  "username": "Bret",
  "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  "address": {
    "street": "Kulas Light",
    "suite": "Apt. 556",
    "city": "Gwenborough",
    "zipcode": "92998-3874",
    "geo": {
      "lat": "-37.3159",
      "lng": "81.1496"
    }
  },
  "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
  "website": "hildegard.org",
  "company": {
    "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
    "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
    "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
  },
  "profilePictureUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/1.png"
}
```

We want our backend to expose these endpoints:

* `/users` list all users.
* `/users/{id}` get user by identifier.

## OpenAPI Specification

An [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) complies with the definition of contract I gave before: Is a set of assertions containing **valid input values** and their meaning, **valid return values** and their meaning, and **error values that can occur** and their meaning.

An OpenAPI Specification that would represent the desired behavior would look something like this:

```yaml

For better visualization you can copy-paste the YAML file into [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or use [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor
in IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14837-openapi-swagger-editor). You should be able to see something like this:

## REST and RESTful

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style defined by [Roy Fielding](https://roy.gbiv.com/), emphasizing:

1. Client-server separation
2. Statelessness
3. Cacheability
4. Layered system
5. Uniform interface (resources, representations)
6. Code-on-demand (optional)

**RESTful** APIs strictly follow *all* these constraints. But here's the thing: **most "REST" APIs aren't truly RESTful**, and that's okay.

### Rest Is Fine

True RESTful APIs require [HATEOAS](https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/) (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)â€”embedding links to related resources in responses:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "links": [
    { "rel": "self", "href": "/users/1" },
    { "rel": "orders", "href": "/users/1/orders" }
  ]
}
```

In practice this doesn't happen:

* Frontend teams rarely use embedded links.
* Adds complexity without immediate value.

An OpenAPI contract already gives you 80% of REST's benefits:

* **Resource-centric URLs** (`/users/{id}`).
* **Standard HTTP methods** (`GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`).
* **Clear error handling** (`4xx`/`5xx` codes).

For those reasons, **we are going to build REST APIs**. Unless you're building hypermedia-driven systems, **REST is fine**. Focus on:

* Consistent contracts.
* Predictable error handling.
* Documentation humans and machines can use.

As your API evolves, you may add RESTful features later if required.
