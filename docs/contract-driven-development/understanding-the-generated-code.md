# Understanding The Generated Code

In the previous document [Generate Code From The Contract](/contract-driven-development/use-the-generated-code), we indicated that all code generated by [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) is in the `build\generated\sources\openapi` folder.

Let’s briefly explore what the openapi-generator produced and why it looks so verbose.

## What’s Inside the Generated Code?

* **Models**: Java classes mirroring your OpenAPI schemas (e.g., `User`). These include validation annotations, serialization logic, and builder patterns.
* **API Interfaces**: Spring `@RestController` interfaces (e.g., `UsersApi`) that define your endpoints and their method signatures.

## Why Does It Look So Complicated?

The generated code includes:

* **Boilerplate** for OpenAPI/Spring compatibility (e.g., `@Validated`, `@Generated` annotations).
* **Validation logic** (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) to enforce your contract.
* **Serialization/deserialization** support (e.g., JSON ↔ Java object mapping).

## Why You Shouldn’t Care (Too Much)

* **It’s autogenerated**: Treat it like a compiled dependency—you use it, not modify it.
* **Contract-first philosophy**: The code exactly matches your OpenAPI spec. If you need changes, update the .yaml file and regenerate.
* **Maintenance-free**: The generator handles updates, so you avoid manual refactoring.

Focus on consuming the generated code, not its internals. Let the tool handle the heavy lifting!
