title: Server and Serverless

import Youtube from '@site/src/components/youtube';

Our applications ultimately need to run _somewhere_. That "somewhere" typically comes down to two options: traditional servers (where you play the house owner) or serverless environments (where you're a cloud nomad). Both approaches keep your code running in the clouds, but one gives you keys to the server room while the other hands you an Uber-like bill. Let's break down these options.

## Server

While serverless gets all the hype, traditional server-based architectures still power enterprise systems. Here's what you need to know:

- **You own the box**: physical (on-premise hardware) or virtual (cloud VMs such as [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)), you have full control over:
  - OS patches and security updates.
  - Scaling strategies (vertical/horizontal).
  - Resource allocation (CPU, RAM, storage).
- **Predictable costs**: Fixed monthly bills regardless of traffic spikes.

## Serverless

The term “Serverless” is a bit misleading. There are still servers involved, but you never see or manage them.

- Instead of worrying about hardware, software updates, or scaling, developers focus purely on writing code.
- Cloud providers (like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), or [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)) handle the grunt work: spinning up servers when needed, patching security holes, balancing traffic, and even backing up data automatically.

### The Serverless Dream can quickly become a nightmare

Serverless computing promises unparalleled scalability, but that flexibility often comes with an unpredictable cost structure.

A striking example of this came to light when [cara.app](https://cara.app/explore), a small indie project, went viral. Built using [serverless functions](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/serverless-functions.html), the app’s sudden popularity led to a staggering $96,000 cloud bill for its creator.

This isn’t an isolated incident. Serverless pricing is heavily based on usage, and while that can seem cost-effective at first, a spike in demand can quickly send your costs into orbit.

## Conclusion: It's Not Either/Or

| Criteria           | Server                          | Serverless                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Cost Structure** | Predictable (fixed/month)       | Variable (pay-per-execution)  |
| **Scaling**        | Manual/auto-scaling setup       | Automatic (but costly spikes) |
| **Maintenance**    | High (you manage everything)    | Zero (cloud provider's duty)  |
| **Control**        | Full control over environment   | Limited to runtime/config     |
| **Cold Starts**    | None (always running)           | There's latency               |
| **Best For**       | Stable workloads, stateful apps | Event-driven, bursty traffic  |

Most teams you'll join have already made this decision years before your arrival. But here's why this matters to **you**:

- **Architecture discussions**: Understand tradeoffs when colleagues debate _migrating to Lambda_.
- **Debugging context**: Issues in serverless (cold starts/timeouts) are different from those in servers (thread pool).
- **Career moves**: Cloud certifications expect this knowledge.
- **Promotion potential**: Roles such as Tech leads need to advise on infrastructure choices.

Whether you're maintaining a dusty server or building serverless microservices, the best architecture is the one your team can operate.
