title: The Sakila Sample Database

Ever heard of [Lorem Ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)? It's that nonsensical Latin filler content designers use when they don't have real copy yet.

Now, imagine that, but for relational databases. You need to test a query, build a demo, write a tutorial, or learn a new SQL dialect. You don't want to waste time inventing a "Users", "Products", "Orders" schema from scratch for the millionth time. Enter **Sakila**.

[Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) is a complete, pre-fabricated sample database schema. Its original incarnation was created by [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to showcase their database's features.

The genius is in the theme: it's built around a DVD rental store. It's familiar, slightly fun, and has just enough complexity (with things like many-to-many relationships, foreign keys, and dated records) to be useful for realistic practice.

Think of it as a well-worn training dummy, you don't question its origins.

## What's the Big Deal?

Here's why you should care, beyond just passing a trivia quiz.

1. **It's universal lore:** Mention "Sakila" to a room of experienced folks, and most will nod in recognition. It comes up in conversations and interviews, similar to [PEBKAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error) and [xkcd 2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/).
2. **It has escaped the MySQL cage:** While born for MySQL, the beauty of Sakila is that the _concept_ and _schema_ have been ported far and wide. You can find official or community adaptations. This makes it a fantastic **Rosetta Stone**. You can learn the nuances of a new database by loading Sakila and trying to write the same queries in a different SQL dialect. The mental model stays constant; only the syntax changes.
3. **It's the perfect teaching tool:** When writing about [Persistent Integration](/category/persistence-integration), I need a consistent, relatable dataset. I'm not going to invent a new one. **I'll be using Sakila.** Consider this your heads-up.

Sakila isn't about the DVDs. It's about having a common, battle-tested starting point. It's the **prior knowledge** that lets us skip the boring "here's my fake database" explanation and jump straight into the good stuff.

This your official brief. You're now in the loop. You know the lore.
